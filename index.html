                After lot of discussions with AcadGild's team, I joined AcadGild's Front End Development course about a
                month back. So far my experience has been great.

                And now I am really glad I took this course.

                Best part of the learning through acadgild is you can do it at home, even after your office hours, if
                you wish to. They are flexible with mentors and timings.

                Till now completed the Front End Fundaments for the first 4 weeks, Mentors at ACADGILD during the
                courses, will meet twice a week during the sessions. They sort our doubts, teach with live examples.They
                also help with the assignments and the projects.

                And now the Advanced Front End Development [12 weeks] course with another mentor not the same mentor is
                going on so far 3 weeks are completed so far so good.

                The focus on coding while learning sessions and the bunch of tips after session to solve assignments
                gave the load hands on experience.

                Till date I have been gaining more confidence about my programming skills. Even though I have 6+ years
                of hands on experience in HTML & CSS and Now little bit with JS too because of Acadgild.

                I sincerely bid my gratitude to AcadGild and the Team.

                Will update again once I finish this course.

                I've tried to learn Android from video tutorials but without success. Then I took this Android course
                with AcadGild and realized the difference having an expert mentor makes. I've been happy with AcadGild's
                hands-on approach, their curriculum, and the interactions with their experienced mentors. Above all,
                their prices are almost 1 / 10th of others. Strongly recommended!

                I just finished a 12 week course with AcadGild's Android Development course. I had a little bit of java
                and android knowledge from books and videos, but after taking AcadGild's course, I realized how much
                better having a mentor is. I learned a whole lot more and more importantly I understood a lot more. My
                mentor gave me good code examples to learn from and she explained everything to help me understand. I
                definitely recommend taking a course from AcadGild.
